constraints that come from within our team, and we have no control over. it may
include:

- working as a group can be challenging, its important to establish clear lines
  of communication and ensure that everyone is on the page same through out the
  project.

constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may
include:

  completing tasks or reaching milestones in the project.
